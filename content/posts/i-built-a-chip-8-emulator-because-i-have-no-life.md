title: 'I built a CHIP-8 emulator because I have no life'
---

> A life going downhill isn't made by a single decision. It's prolly made by a bunch of shitty ones.

That line echoed in my skull while I stared at the screen, wondering why I just spent hours building a CHIP-8 emulator — from scratch — for no reason. Well, not no reason. Maybe because I needed to prove to myself that I could. Maybe because it kept me distracted. Or maybe because I don't know how to stop building things that nobody asked for.

Some people climb mountains.
Some people find love.
I implemented opcodes in a virtual machine from 1977.

And the worst part?

**I liked it.**

## What Even Is a CHIP-8?

A virtual machine from the 70s, originally designed to make it easier to write games on ancient hardware. It has 35 instructions. A tiny screen. Monochrome graphics. No soundcard. No GPU.

You'd think that'd make it easier.\
It doesn’t.\
It just makes it _different_.

So I wrote an emulator. Then a disassembler. Then an assembler.\
And for what?

So I could watch Pong render in blocky pixels in a window I coded myself. I even added a UI, because apparently I hate myself just enough to do frontend work in **Dear ImGui**.

## Why?

I wish I had better answers. I wish I knew why I act the way I do.

The best theory I've got?\
I'M WEIRD. 

Building an emulator means having almost complete control over a program someone else wrote. You know what that means?\
I can cook up an instruction like `0xFFFF`, call it `NUKE`, and make it randomly scramble registers or nuke memory.

And I call that **POWER**.

## ALERT: This isn't a Technical Post!

If you hate yourself enough to want to build an emulator, hey — welcome to the club. I get it.

But there are _much better resources_ for getting started than this unhinged rant.

This isn’t about instruction decoding.
This isn’t about binary operations or SDL2 event loops.

This post is about **pain**.\
It’s about not **learning lessons**.\
It’s about **reinventing the wheel and calling it art**.
