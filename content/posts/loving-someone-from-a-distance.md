_"I wish we had never met"_

Have you ever felt the same with someone so close to you?

You adored. Loved them. You would've gone to any length just to keep their world intact.
What if being away from them was the best thing after all?

You wish you'd never met them.\
Or only knew their whereabouts.\
You wish you were dead,\
not to vanish, but to watch -\
closely, yet from far enough away.

"Distance" is the key here.\
Your presence, your mere proximity to them was enough to alter who they were.\
You were their Hemlock - poison dressed as love.\
You robbed them of their innocence,\
even as you tried to preserve it.

"Distance" was again, necessary.\
The lack thereof made you inseparable,\
but so was the separation unavoidable.\
You plucked the last bloom from the dying plant,\
hoping it would bloom again in your hands.\
But flowers don't forgive.\
And neither do you.

It was never the leaving that hurt - It was the Promises.\
They were made; were broken.\
Once a beautiful portrait of together,\
Now it burns --\
Not just the picture, but everything it ever meant.

_And you wish you'd never met them."_
