      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://github.com/Muhammed-Rajab/telnet.cpp"><em><strong>repo</strong></em></a>, if you are in a hurry.</p>
<p>OK, I want to set the record straight: Before starting this project, I barely had any idea about telnet and its applications. Come on, what did you expect? I&rsquo;m 19. <strong>&ldquo;Old days&rdquo; - pfff!</strong></p>
<p>I always saw this word pop-up in networking articles I read, and you&rsquo;ll always find this term in every article that&rsquo;s titled</p>
<p><em><strong>10 Cool Linux Terminal Tricks That You Should Know - And More!</strong></em></p>
<p>So I decided to search it up in my favorite search engine (i use google, btw), and oh boy, was it cool.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-telnet-really-all-about">So what&rsquo;s Telnet really all about?</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how Wikipedia describes Telnet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The telnet protocol is a client-server protocol that runs on a reliable connection-oriented transport. Most often, a telnet client connects over TCP to port 23 or 2323, where a Telnet server application is listening. The Telnet protocol abstracts any terminal as a Network Virtual Terminal (NVT). The client must simulate a NVT using the NVT codes when messaging the server.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through it like the good programmers we pretend to be are:</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s basically a way to connect to a TCP server, get the data, display, and maybe send some data back to the server. That&rsquo;s it. When I hear &ldquo;Telnet&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not thinking about NVT and all that, I&rsquo;m too young for that.</p>
<p>Personally, telnet is just a cool way for me to watch star wars.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This was all I had in my mind when I read about telnet. A super high budget movie but in terminal rendered in ASCII, moving at a super smooth frame rate and ridiculously high resolution? What more can I ask for?</p>
<p>And when I finally tried it out, here&rsquo;s what I got</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>‚ûú telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Trying 213.136.8.188...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Well, that sucks.</p>
<p>My dreams were shattered into smithereens. My eyes welled up, hips trembling, spirit crushed. AAHHHHHHHHHHH (dramatic cat noises)</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. We all are meant to be disappointed. Life ain&rsquo;t that easy, girl. Get over it.</p>
<p>This was enough to give me the motivation needed to work on my own TCP server application and I knew exactly what to do.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-telnetcpp">Introducing telnet.cpp</h2>
<p>A simple TCP server which allows you to go through a grand collection of 2 (as of today) telnet applications. So cool, isn&rsquo;t it? Being as creative as a half-cut potato molding on the bottom shelf of the Fridge, I decided to name it <code>telnet.cpp</code>. And yes, I&rsquo;ll be using <code>C++</code> for the project, and here are the 13 reasons why I chose to use it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I hate myself</strong></li>
<li><strong>I love to boast</strong></li>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;ll have to use C++ a lot in the near future</strong></li>
<li><strong>The &lsquo;M&rsquo; is Masochist stands for me</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
<li><strong>-</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t feel obliged to give all the 13 reasons. If you&rsquo;ve ever done anything in <code>C++</code>, you can probably fill out the rest yourself.</p>
<p>The plan is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the user a menu to choose from.</li>
<li>On choosing a program, render it to screen, accept user input, etc.</li>
<li>Make it clean enough and allow multiple users.</li>
</ul>
<p>This won&rsquo;t be a step-by-step guide on how to make one. The code I wrote is soo clean and self explanatory, even if you never did anything in <code>C++</code>, you&rsquo;ll understand pretty much the whole thing, given that you have some idea about sockets in Linux. Yes, we&rsquo;ll be using Linux sockets, not <code>winsock</code> (i !use arch, btw).</p>
<h2 id="telnet-app-1-kittysays">Telnet App #1: kitty.says()</h2>
<p>A wise eye-blinking kitty giving you advice over the wire - could you be any more blessed? The app is quite simple. You store the kitty as frames, pair them with a bunch of quotes, and give the user the ability to go back to the menu, quit or even change the quote. Simple enough, right? It is.</p>
<p>Most of the difficulty you&rsquo;ll be facing here will be related to handling user input. You will struggle a bit with <strong>&ldquo;IaCs&rdquo;</strong> (Interpret as Commands), Typeahead buffers, and some other quirky little stuff.</p>
<p>And in the end, I was left with this little thingy:</p>
<p><img alt="kitty.says()" loading="lazy" src="/blog/images/kitty-says.gif"></p>
<h2 id="telnet-app-2-cuberender">Telnet App #2: cube.render()</h2>
<p>This&hellip; this is it. This was something that I wanted to try for quite some time. A rotating wireframe cube with controls. A few months back I built <a href="https://github.com/Muhammed-Rajab/terrible-renderer.cpp">terrible-renderer.cpp</a>, and it was one of my favorite projects till date. I finally got the chance to understand 3D rendering, and I built something that&rsquo;s very close to my heart - <strong>a fricking spinning DONUTüç©!</strong></p>
<p>Ever since I started programming, I was so captivated by <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">Andy Sloane&rsquo;s Donut.c</a>. It was my dream to build it myself one day. That <em>myself</em> part is quite important here. I want the math behind the rendering to slowly consume me from my inside, I didn&rsquo;t want to just copy paste the code. And once I got there, I faced another challenge: How can I make this a cube?</p>
<p>There are several videos that explains the math behind the rendering, but it&rsquo;s pretty much the same.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Generate Surface Coordinates -&gt; Transformation -&gt; Projection -&gt; Lighting -&gt; Rendering
</code></pre><p>I attempted rendering the surface of the cube and I got a pretty satisfying result. But then I wanted to try something else. Something easier, but fun to do. So I chose to stick with Wireframe (no messy Z-Buffers, haha).</p>
<p>And in the end, I was left with this big thingy,</p>
<p><img alt="cube.render()" loading="lazy" src="/blog/images/cube-render.gif"></p>
<p>As you can see, there are a few controls that you can mess around with to modify the cube&rsquo;s behaviour. Just make sure to press <strong>RETURN</strong> after any control input (That&rsquo;s how the server gets your input).</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end&hellip;</h2>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</p>
<p>Nah, it does. I learned quite a bit from this project. I got to do some Linear Algebra, brush up on <code>C++</code>, and brag about the whole thing on Instagram. Ahhhhhh, INNER PEACE üïäÔ∏è</p>
<p>The project isn&rsquo;t complete yet. I have to rewrite the server to handle multiple concurrent connections. Maybe polish the menu a bit? But I&rsquo;ll be sure to keep you updated here, love üíñ.</p>
