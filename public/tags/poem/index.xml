      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&ldquo;I wish we had never met&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Have you ever felt the same with someone so close to you?</p>
<p>You adored them. Loved them. You would&rsquo;ve gone to any length just to keep their world intact.
What if being away from them was the best thing after all?</p>
<p>You wish you&rsquo;d never met them.<br>
Or only knew their whereabouts.<br>
You wish you were dead,<br>
not to vanish, but to watch -<br>
closely, yet from far enough away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distance&rdquo; is the key here.<br>
Your presence, your mere proximity to them was enough to alter who they were.<br>
You were their Hemlock - poison dressed as love.<br>
You robbed them of their innocence,<br>
even as you tried to preserve it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distance&rdquo; was again, necessary.<br>
The lack thereof made you inseparable,<br>
but so was the separation unavoidable.<br>
You plucked the last bloom from the dying plant,<br>
hoping it would bloom again in your hands.<br>
But flowers don&rsquo;t forgive.<br>
And neither do you.</p>
<p>It was never the leaving that hurt - It was the Promises.<br>
They were made; were broken.<br>
Once a beautiful portrait of together,<br>
Now it burns &ndash;<br>
Not just the picture, but everything it ever meant.</p>
<p><em>And you wish you&rsquo;d never met them.&quot;</em></p>
